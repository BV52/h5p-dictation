# h5p-dictation
Let your students train their listening comprehension and spelling skills.

You can e.g. upload sound samples that contain a recording of someone reading a sentence. Students can play these sound samples (n times) and enter what they hear.

## TODO before first release
- Change diff style
- Add optional image on top
- Add optional text on top
- Implement Contract
- Check ARIA
- Tidying up

## Ideas to think about ...
- Could be interesting, but the use case might be rather particular for this content type: Audio Recorder widget which would allow to record the reading directly from within H5P/enhance Audio widget. (future option)
- Do we need an option for different diff styles?
- How to balance speed/pitch?
